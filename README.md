## Build

### Debugging

By default, Raspberry Pi SWD debugging is configured as target.
To use it, you need to install an openocd version with support for the Raspberry Pi SWD interface.
Please refer to the [RaspberryPi documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/debug-probe.html#installing-openocd) for more information.
